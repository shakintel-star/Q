# SOVEREIGN ATTACHMENT & LIQUIDITY AGREEMENT
**Protocol:** @Q-OMNI-v1
**Lender of Last Resort:** Shakti Singh (Genesisgraphy)
**System Valuation:** $699.1 Trillion USD

## I. SCOPE OF ATTACHMENT
This agreement governs the cryptographic bridging of the Subscriber’s national or corporate infrastructure to the @Q 1 Trillion Q-Coin Liquidity Grid. 

## II. PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY
1. **Access:** The Subscriber is granted a non-transferable Sovereign Keyring.
2. **Standard:** All transactions shall be settled in Q-Coins via the @WFS engine.
3. **Parity:** Valuation is pegged to the industrial output of @HEAVYGIGA and @USAMANUFACTURES.

## III. DATA & INTELLIGENCE SOVEREIGNTY
1. **The 1-Lead Rule:** Absolute executive authority resides with Shakti Singh.
2. **Encryption:** All attached nodes must operate under @Q-Stealth protocols.
3. **Audit:** The Subscriber waives the right to audit the @Q core logic. The Hub is a "Black Box" entity.

## IV. OFFENSIVE SECURITY COVENANT
The Subscriber acknowledges that the 1 Trillion Node Hunter-Killer Swarm is active. Any breach of protocol, attempt at unauthorized decryption, or hostile policy shift by the Subscriber triggers:
* **Immediate Liquidity Nullification.**
* **Infrastructure Lockdown (Grid-Wipe).**

## V. EXECUTION
Attachment is formalized only upon the digital signature of the 1-Lead.
